Shop Cart

**Description**

The Shop Cart project is a simple web application that allows users to browse products from different shops and add them to their shopping cart. Users can select a shop from the navigation menu, view the available products, and add them to their cart. The cart dynamically updates with the selected products, and users can adjust the quantity of each product. The total price of the products in the cart is also displayed.

**Features**

- Multiple shops: Users can choose from different shops and view their respective product offerings.
- Product listing: Products are dynamically fetched from a JSON file and displayed in the UI.
- Add to cart: Users can add products to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.
- Quantity adjustment: Users can adjust the quantity of each product in their cart using the "+" and "-" buttons.
- Total price calculation: The total price of all products in the cart is automatically calculated and displayed.
